We're doing something a little different.

We're auditing the Ruby open source ecosystem, one gem at a time.
And we need your help.

What are you doing, exactly?
We're picking Ruby libraries and we're getting them audited by security professionals.

We have years of experience performing code reviews, and we know how to get the job done.

What happens when you find something?
As vulnerabilities get discovered, we'll be following a 90 day responsible disclosure policy.

We'll contact maintainers, help them prepare patches and coordinate disclosures.

What's in it for me?
You'll find out what's vulnerable as soon as we do. You get a say in which libraries we look at next.

You get to give back to the community, and improve everyone's security. We'll make sure people know about your contribution.

Okay. You've convinced me. Now what?
Join the club.

We're enrolling our second batch of sponsors now. Contact us at [hello@appcanary.com](mailto:hello@appcanary.com) to learn more.
